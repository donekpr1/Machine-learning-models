# FAKE NEWS DETECTION<b>

1.Trained a Real Fake news dataset of 44898 records referenced from Kaggle using deep learning models.<b>
Requirements:
2.Python Jupiter Notebook of version 3.6 used by colab,Keras APIs,NLTK library,Visualization libraries like matplotlib,seaborn,and Wordcloud are used along withNumpy,Pandas are required for the execution.
3.Models to be imported:Bilstm,BiGRU,CNN,Passive Agressive classifier
4.Of all,considering the execution time of Hybrid model(CNN+BiGRU) is less and the model(CNN+Passive Agressive Classifier) furnished for online learning approach.Further tuning of the models is required since the accuracy resulted to be same i.e, 99% and to be tested on
other datasets.
5.Embedding vectors evaluated Word2vec,Glove and tested for BiLSTM.
6.Detail level information is furnished in the project report.
7.Code syntaxes are referenced from https://keras.io/ and few tutorials online.


This project also contains another python file that has traditional ML models comparision using countvectorization and tfidf using ML pipeline.
The deep learning models comparision file has Word2Vec,Glove implementation using BiLSTM,GRU,CNN with Passive aggressive classifier to implement online learning.
